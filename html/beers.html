						<p>Once a thriving and flourishing business more than a century ago, the Squamish Valley was known for its commercial hop farming, with the Squamish Valley Hop Ranch supplying hops to the British Empire. At this time, breweries also dotted the BC landscape, but with the advent of Prohibition the number of hops farms and operating breweries dwindled. By the 1970's, only a few hop farms remained in BC, and the brewing scene was dominated by just a few large breweries.</p>
